# student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage a list of students 
enrolled at Villians Academy

## What is this?

From a simple code base that is built up during the tutorials there are a 
series of exercises to promote the principals of refactoring. 

In this case I treated the first number of exercises as individual changes and created
new files for each change. More for my own readability and also that some of the changes 
were not iterative on the previous exercise.

For the last set of exercises the file directory_interactive.rb was created and all 
changes were done on the same code base. Primarilu because these exercises were very
much on going refactoring.
